# Master Debater

Running the application locally requires [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com) to be installed.

Once installed just run `meteor` from the root of the project and a browser will open with the app running.

### Deployment

The URL of the ap once deployed is: https://master-debator.herokuapp.com/
